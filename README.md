# First-Project

PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THIS PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED YET. 

This is my first project after finishing the Coders Lab bootcamp for Front-End Developers.

It consists of two parts.


Part One

Is a mini game in black and white. You are playing a recruiter who has to escape from the zombie. The zombie is randomly moving on the playboard. When the zombie catches you the page will turn red and the game is over but you can escape into the job candidates house. When you made it into the house a new page will open automatically which is the second part of my project. 
The first part is mostly made in JavaScript only a little part was made in ReactJS. The game was styled in Sass and compiled to CSS with Gulp.

Part Two

Is a simple webpage with information about myself. It is designed as a my home. It is also mostly in black and white colors because I wanted to style it similar to the first part. In my home you will find a navigation menu which consists out of 4 menu buttons which are named by different rooms of my home except the last button which is named "Contact". Clicking on each button you will "enter" the room but you can also simple scroll down. When you move the mouse over the picture which is one of my so-called rooms you will see a hover effect and find information about myself. Each room is a part of myself with information from my CV. The contact part you will find all my contact details which you can also see below the navigation bar. Clicking on the left side in the footer you can return to the first part the "mini zombie game".
The webpage is made in ReactJS and is responsive for smaller displays like tablets or smartphones. The jsx part is compiled with Webpack and styled in Sass and compiled to CSS with Gulp. The whole page is splitted into appropiate parts with flexbox.
